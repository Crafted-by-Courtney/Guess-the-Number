# Guess-the-Number
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game! This is a simple web-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Approach Taken

The Guess the Number Game is designed to provide a user-friendly and interactive experience. The game is implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure and user interface, the CSS adds styling and visual appeal, and the JavaScript handles the game logic, including generating random numbers, tracking scores, and handling user input.

The game starts by prompting the player to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, informing them whether the guessed number is too low or too high.

The game also features a separate scoring system for the player and the computer. The player's score increases when they guess the correct number, and the computer's score increases when the player loses.

## Unsolved Problems

- **High Scores:** Currently, the game does not have a high-score tracking feature. This could be a potential future enhancement to add more competitiveness to the game.

- **Responsive Design:** The current design is not fully responsive and may not work well on smaller screens. Improving the responsiveness of the game's layout is an area for further development.
